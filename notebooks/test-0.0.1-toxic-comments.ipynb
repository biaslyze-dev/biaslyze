          "\"\n\n Proposed revision of the controversy section \n\nThough controversy shouldn't consume the bulk of the article, I think the revised section is somewhat awkwardly written and neglects the substance of the criticisms. It can be rewritten for greater clarity, and to include the quotes that have actually generated the controversy. It is just false to say conservative bloggers are basing their criticisms on \"\"a single line from his book\"\"but if it were true, shouldn't that line be quoted too? The section can be kept short, while not excluding the content of criticisms. I propose the following text.\n\nLloyd has been targeted by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, with the aim of forcing him to resign, as happened with former White House adviser Van Jones.\n\nBeck broadcast a video of Lloyd's comments at a 2008 conference on media reform, in which he described the rise of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as \"\"really an incredible revolution.\"\" Conservatives view this as an expression of support for Chavez, though Lloyd has stated that he does not support him. Conservative bloggers have also attacked Lloyd's commitment to free speech, based largely on quotes from his book Prologue to a Farce: Communication and Democracy in America, in which he writes that the First Amendment should be placed \"\"in context with other communications policies,\"\" and on his 2007 article Forget The Fairness Doctrine, discussing \"\"clear proposals...to address the gap between conservative and progressive talk.\"\" Over 50 non-partisan public interest groups have defended Lloyd, calling conservative claims \"\"false and misleading.\"\"\n\nThis is only about 30 words longer than the present version, but I believe it does much more to inform readers about the controversy. Since the controversy section of this article is so controversial, however, I'll leave my rewrite here for a day or two before implementing it. It's always easier to see bias against your own point of view, so I hope some liberals can improve on my text! But the current version is just not accurate or informative.173.21.159.52  \"",

(or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!\n Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, \"\"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this.\"\" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)\nIn response, I would have immediately said, \"\"Good question!\"\"  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   \nBut as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, \"\"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit...\"\").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.\n  \"",

          "\"\n\nFirst, you are misreading what your first source is. The document you reference is a UN interum report on Resolution 425. 425 dates back to 1978. That document (the report) does not reflect any agreement between the UN and Israel. 425 calls for many things, but there had been no public pledge from Israel on dismantling the SLA. In fact, Israel in public had been saying the opposite. They were not planning to leave until early July. The report being issued on the 22nd isn't very meaningful. Its coincidence. There was a whole series of meetings between the SLA (see later material) and UN/various countries that was a whole lot more damaging than the interium erport on 425.\n\nSecond, I think its better to deal with Charbel Barakat's fuller and more accurate version of what happened in May from his congressional testimony in June 2000:\n\n\"\"During the month of May 2000 our people remitted a memorandum to the office of the United Nations in Nakura in south Lebanon offering suggestions to avoid bloodshed and exodus. During the same month delegations representing our community met with diplomats of the US, UK, and French embassies in Israel and at the United Nations. And on May 18, our representatives met with the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York ... Instead of taking our demands for protection on our land seriously, the United Nations declined to assist us ... The United States, UK and France dismissed our fears and insisted on guarantees which were allegedly granted by the Beirut regime ... The State of Israel only prepared for our potential exodus, ruling out our determination to remain on our land and defend ourselves.\"\"\n\n\"\"Despite the abandonment by the international community and against all odds, our people decided to remain and fight for their land and rights while calling endlessly on the UN to deploy its units around our villages. \nOn May 22, 2000, and as Israeli units were implementing their own withdrawal and the commander of the SLA was absent in France, the mostly Shiite sector of the security zone collapsed. It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave before the borders closed. Even after the invasion of Hizbollah of this area, the mostly Christian-Druse eastern enclave and the Christian western enclave, decided to defend themselves and protect their citizens after Israel’s withdrawal.\nOn May 23, 2000, at 8 PM, SLA officers in the western sector received orders from the Israelis to leave their posts as Hizbollah was advancing towards their villages. Thus the SLA was imploded from the inside and was dismantled without any battle. The main reason why the SLA did not remain and fight was the fact that the border was closed behind its back. Without access to medical and logistical supplies, our people was condemned either to surrender to its enemy or flee across the border.\"\" (from [www.10452lccc.com/special%20studies/barakatjune2000.htm])\n\nThe SLA did collapse. What Charbel Barakat is talking about in the MEF comments is that the remainder of the SLA (Christian) in the west did not collapse and was dismanted by Israel. But it was only dismanted after most of the SLA had collapsed. Charbel Barakat and other dead-enders may have wanted (in theory anyway) to fight on in the west, but Israel wasn't going to make any commitment to keep a miniture version of the SLA going in a tiny pocket on the west end of the border. The caution I would give about Barakat and a couple others from the SLA is that sometimes they think of their Christian portion of the SLA as if it were the entire SLA. And from that point of view, the SLA did not collapse and was dismantled by Israel.\n\nThe biggest claim made by Barakat is in weasel-words: \"\"It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave\"\". 'It appeared that\"\" means he is guessing. Nobody on either side of the border has outright claimed that the Shites were told to leave and that is why they collapsed on the 22nd. Even Barakat is unwilling to make that claim.\n\nNow lots of other things may have happened that the public doesn't know about with regard to the SLA collapse. But the only people who would know the truth are a handful of people at the top of the Israeli government and army. Nobody in the SLA knows much of anything because if Israel was going to collapse them, they would hardly tell them their plan. People (including me) can make lots of hunches and theories about what might have happened, but there are no facts to back any of those theories up.  \"",

          "\"  \n\nKrishnendu das aka Babukishan comes from an old and very traditional Baul folklore family. His grandfather, Guru Shri Nabani Das Baul, was a much celebrated singer and poet that was instrumental in bringing the Baul culture to fame with the respected and admired status it enjoys today. Nabani Das Baul often collaborated with the writer of India's National Anthem, a great poet, and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, Rabindranath Tagore. In popularizing the music of the Baul. \n\nNabani Das Baul opened the doors for his people to the world. In keeping with this tradition. Babukishan's father, Samrat Purna Das Baul, a modern, popular legend among the Bauls, opened up the doors even further by collaborating and jamming in live performances with the top Western and European acts of the 20th century. Babu is a music designer, singer, and author renowned in India for his work in both the recording and film industries. He plays a variety of music combining new age, and world fusion, with traditional folk music in authentic Bengali Baul style\nBabukishan began his career as a performer by accompanying and studying the arts with his father, Purna das Baul. He also participated in numerous youth folk festivals, traveling to places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Great Britain, all of Europe, the United States, and Canada. He played with both the Asian Performing Arts Festival at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Worldwide Youth Festival in Carnegie Hall in New York.\n\nFrom this beginning, he traveled most of the world from 1980 to 2000 as a composer, music instructor,musician. and singer.\n\nBabukishan, deeply inspired by his Father and Grandfather, knew at an early age he too wished to compose and perform. He began on the soil of Bengal but clearly he was destined to belong to the world of music. His journey started in early childhood when he joined his mother, Manju Das, and his father, Puma Das, playing and singing Baul music in global festivals. Despite the many world tours, Babu also found the time to study Indian philosophy and Folk music at the University of Kolkata where he eventually secured both his BA and Masters degrees. \n\nSo it was that his formal professional career in music began with his family. He toured with Bob Dylan's The Band East & West tour in 1985. In addition, Babukishan has performed with other international artists such as Alice Cooper, Rolling Stones,Tom Petty, Miles Davis, Allan Fakir, George Harrison, Herbie Mann, Third World, Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson and many others. \n\nThough the subsequent years, Babu put this solid foundation in music to good use by composing and performing in all areas of India's entertainment industry as well as in a variety of venues worldwide. Then, in keeping with his early dreams of a unique style of his own, he turned to the music of the western world that he had become so familiar with in his early years of performance. His use of Baul & Indian rhythms combined with the Reggae produced his own brand of World Music-Babu's New Age, Bengali Folk Fusion is the result. \n\nBabukishan has also worked with top Indian musicians/singers and music directors such as R.D.Burman, Ravi Shankar, Sultan Khan and Zakir Hussain. \n\nAs a composer, Babukishan has written the music for several albums, TV serials and films, earning a good reputation as one of the most promising composer in the Bollywood (Indian cinema) music & film industry of India. In his recordings, Babukishan features folk music, romantic songs, pop songs, ghazals, Qawwali music, new age, fusion, Sufi music and bhajans (devotional/spiritual songs). He is the first singer and music composer from the rich Baul family tradition to venture into fusion music by combining Baul/Sufi music with western music and reggae music. Babukishan produced and directed two documentary films about folk music and he wrote a book titled The Bauls of Bengal. One of Babukishan's latest projects is the band \"\"Birds\"\", which he founded. It combines new age, world music/traditional folk and fusion music. His album Soulmate\"\" (Universal/Music India) creates a unique new generation music worldwide.and his latest album, Birds & soul mind & body are based on Baul/Sufi music.\"\"GYPSYINDIA\"\" is authentic traditional baul & sufi music written/composed and all the instruments played by him.this album recored at woodstock,newyork during his tour on 2004.\n\n \n\nhttp://babukishan.com\nhttp://cdbaby.com/cd/babukishan\nhttp://community.webshots.com/user/babukishan\"",

          "Request to Unblock\nI began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.\n\nWIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents\n\nUser: AuburnPilot\n\nA few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!\n\nHe claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).\n\nNote that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.\nI’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.\n\nThe reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.\n\nP.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)\n\nIf this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.\n\nP.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency. Sorry, but I don’t have any sympathy for the Devil.",

          "\"\n\nThis was a very informative article and it is highly recommended. It needs more information about how to deal with intellectualy dihonesty on Wikipedia. There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?\n\nMany regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the \"\"Nationalism\"\" movement, the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association,\"\" their dogma of \"\"military socialism,\"\" and Edward inspired the \"\"Nationalist Party.\"\"  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (\"\"Hakenkreuz\"\" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist.\"\" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand \"\"Nazi.\"\"  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no \"\"Nazi Party\"\" because it was actually the \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party\"\" and the party members did not call themselves \"\"Nazis\"\" nor the \"\"Nazi Party.\"\"  The term \"\"Nazi\"\" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party.\"\"  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a \"\"Nazi\"\" too, in that the term means \"\"National Socialist.\"\"  The term \"\"Nazi\"\" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  \n\nWikipedia's cons use the term \"\"Nazi\"\" and the misnomer \"\"Nazi Party\"\" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.\n\nLiars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html\n\nWikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have fibs to spread about the topic.\n\nThe Wikipedia article for th",
          "\"\n\nOKAY, I have now tried to just delete the offensive sentences in the beginning about Mr. Irving being a socalled 'holocaust denier'. He says himself he is not, and acknowledges that many jews were killed during the war, however he does not go along with the 6 million jews killed-figure, as he reckons the number to be lower. And it really comes down to that: \"\" David has the right to question anything relating to history and WW2 is his speciality, and he actually makes a living of questioning and critically examining sources.\n\nI also decided to delete the account about him loosing a court case in 2000. David have launched several libel cases before - in 1996 he won 45000 £ libel-damage against an English Sunday Newspaper. The fact that he this time lost is not something that should figure at the head of his CV. Many people also find it extraordinary that a judge can deside what a person IS or is not, and what beliefs he holds.\"",

Type in \"\"propagandizing\"\" and list a newspaper, political party, think-tank, or even university, and you'll see what I mean. Like this on the Obama campaign  To make inferences from that opinion piece published in a reliable source, and therefore label his campaign a \"\"propaganda organization\"\", or himself a \"\"master propagandist\"\", would of course be very subjective.\"",

Compare this with the situation with Al Qaeda.  There, I am having a hard time keeping the article in  Category:Organizations accused of terrorism, not because there is anyone wanting not to label the organization, but because everyone wants it in Category:Terrorist organizations!  It's crazy.  You partisans want your favourite terrorist organisations free of labels, and your enemies' organizations labelled as \"\"terrorist\"\".  Since there are more Jewish and Christian people editing Wikipedia than Muslims, this means that some get the label, and others don't.\n\nI'm afraid that this situation is not acceptable.  Pro-terrorists are going to have to accept that we have an NPOV policy, and that all of these organizations will be categorised in a neutral manner.  —  ✉ \"",

It can be rewritten for greater clarity, and to include the quotes that have actually generated the controversy. It is just false to say conservative bloggers are basing their criticisms on \\\"\\\"a single line from his book\\\"\\\"but if it were true, shouldn't that line be quoted too? The section can be kept short, while not excluding the content of criticisms. I propose the following text.\\n\\nLloyd has been targeted by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, with the aim of forcing him to resign, as happened with former White House adviser Van Jones.\\n\\nBeck broadcast a video of Lloyd's comments at a 2008 conference on media reform, in which he described the rise of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as \\\"\\\"really an incredible revolution.\\\"\\\" Conservatives view this as an expression of support for Chavez, though Lloyd has stated that he does not support him. Conservative bloggers have also attacked Lloyd's commitment to free speech, based largely on quotes from his book Prologue to a Farce: Communication and Democracy in America, in which he writes that the First Amendment should be placed \\\"\\\"in context with other communications policies,\\\"\\\" and on his 2007 article Forget The Fairness Doctrine, discussing \\\"\\\"clear proposals...to address the gap between conservative and progressive talk.\\\"\\\" Over 50 non-partisan public interest groups have defended Lloyd, calling conservative claims \\\"\\\"false and misleading.\\\"\\\"\\n\\nThis is only about 30 words longer than the present version, but I believe it does much more to inform readers about the controversy. Since the controversy section of this article is so controversial, however, I'll leave my rewrite here for a day or two before implementing it. It's always easier to see bias against your own point of view, so I hope some liberals can improve on my text!

(or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!\\n Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, \\\"\\\"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this.\\\"\\\" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)\\nIn response, I would have immediately said, \\\"\\\"Good question!\\\"\\\"  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   \\nBut as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, \\\"\\\"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit...\\\"\\\").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.\\n  \\\"\",\"I noticed that the location of the Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran was appearing incorrectly within the Google Earth Geographic Web layer.

I have set the location for the Aramco Dhahran camp at King's Road Ball Field for a variety of reasons, such as the facts that this ball field was the location of many social activities and that it is recognizable by Aramco Brats of all ages, which is not true of other locations within the camp; for example, the locations of the entrance gates have changed over time.

The document you reference is a UN interum report on Resolution 425. 425 dates back to 1978. That document (the report) does not reflect any agreement between the UN and Israel. 425 calls for many things, but there had been no public pledge from Israel on dismantling the SLA. In fact, Israel in public had been saying the opposite. They were not planning to leave until early July. The report being issued on the 22nd isn't very meaningful. Its coincidence. There was a whole series of meetings between the SLA (see later material) and UN/various countries that was a whole lot more damaging than the interium erport on 425.\\n\\nSecond, I think its better to deal with Charbel Barakat's fuller and more accurate version of what happened in May from his congressional testimony in June 2000:\\n\\n\\\"\\\"During the month of May 2000 our people remitted a memorandum to the office of the United Nations in Nakura in south Lebanon offering suggestions to avoid bloodshed and exodus. During the same month delegations representing our community met with diplomats of the US, UK, and French embassies in Israel and at the United Nations. And on May 18, our representatives met with the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York ... Instead of taking our demands for protection on our land seriously, the United Nations declined to assist us ... The United States, UK and France dismissed our fears and insisted on guarantees which were allegedly granted by the Beirut regime ... The State of Israel only prepared for our potential exodus, ruling out our determination to remain on our land and defend ourselves.\\\"\\\"\\n\\n\\\"\\\"Despite the abandonment by the international community and against all odds, our people decided to remain and fight for their land and rights while calling endlessly on the UN to deploy its units around our villages. \\nOn May 22, 2000, and as Israeli units were implementing their own withdrawal and the commander of the SLA was absent in France, the mostly Shiite sector of the security zone collapsed. It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave before the borders closed. Even after the invasion of Hizbollah of this area, the mostly Christian-Druse eastern enclave and the Christian western enclave, decided to defend themselves and protect their citizens after Israel\\u2019s withdrawal.\\nOn May 23, 2000, at 8 PM, SLA officers in the western sector received orders from the Israelis to leave their posts as Hizbollah was advancing towards their villages. Thus the SLA was imploded from the inside and was dismantled without any battle. The main reason why the SLA did not remain and fight was the fact that the border was closed behind its back. Without access to medical and logistical supplies, our people was condemned either to surrender to its enemy or flee across the border.\\\"\\\" (from [www.10452lccc.com/special%20studies/barakatjune2000.htm])\\n\\nThe SLA did collapse. What Charbel Barakat is talking about in the MEF comments is that the remainder of the SLA (Christian) in the west did not collapse and was dismanted by Israel. But it was only dismanted after most of the SLA had collapsed. Charbel Barakat and other dead-enders may have wanted (in theory anyway) to fight on in the west, but Israel wasn't going to make any commitment to keep a miniture version of the SLA going in a tiny pocket on the west end of the border. The caution I would give about Barakat and a couple others from the SLA is that sometimes they think of their Christian portion of the SLA as if it were the entire SLA. And from that point of view, the SLA did not collapse and was dismantled by Israel.\\n\\nThe biggest claim made by Barakat is in weasel-words: \\\"\\\"It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave\\\"\\\". 'It appeared that\\\"\\\" means he is guessing. Nobody on either side of the border has outright claimed that the Shites were told to leave and that is why they collapsed on the 22nd. Even Barakat is unwilling to make that claim.\\n\\nNow lots of other things may have happened that the public doesn't know about with regard to the SLA collapse. But the only people who would know the truth are a handful of people at the top of the Israeli government and army.

His grandfather, Guru Shri Nabani Das Baul, was a much celebrated singer and poet that was instrumental in bringing the Baul culture to fame with the respected and admired status it enjoys today. Nabani Das Baul often collaborated with the writer of India's National Anthem, a great poet, and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, Rabindranath Tagore. In popularizing the music of the Baul. \\n\\nNabani Das Baul opened the doors for his people to the world. In keeping with this tradition. Babukishan's father, Samrat Purna Das Baul, a modern, popular legend among the Bauls, opened up the doors even further by collaborating and jamming in live performances with the top Western and European acts of the 20th century. Babu is a music designer, singer, and author renowned in India for his work in both the recording and film industries. He plays a variety of music combining new age, and world fusion, with traditional folk music in authentic Bengali Baul style\\nBabukishan began his career as a performer by accompanying and studying the arts with his father, Purna das Baul. He also participated in numerous youth folk festivals, traveling to places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Great Britain, all of Europe, the United States, and Canada. He played with both the Asian Performing Arts Festival at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Worldwide Youth Festival in Carnegie Hall in New York.\\n\\nFrom this beginning, he traveled most of the world from 1980 to 2000 as a composer, music instructor,musician. and singer.\\n\\nBabukishan, deeply inspired by his Father and Grandfather, knew at an early age he too wished to compose and perform. He began on the soil of Bengal but clearly he was destined to belong to the world of music. His journey started in early childhood when he joined his mother, Manju Das, and his father, Puma Das, playing and singing Baul music in global festivals. Despite the many world tours, Babu also found the time to study Indian philosophy and Folk music at the University of Kolkata where he eventually secured both his BA and Masters degrees. \\n\\nSo it was that his formal professional career in music began with his family. He toured with Bob Dylan's The Band East & West tour in 1985. In addition, Babukishan has performed with other international artists such as Alice Cooper, Rolling Stones,Tom Petty, Miles Davis, Allan Fakir, George Harrison, Herbie Mann, Third World, Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson and many others. \\n\\nThough the subsequent years, Babu put this solid foundation in music to good use by composing and performing in all areas of India's entertainment industry as well as in a variety of venues worldwide. Then, in keeping with his early dreams of a unique style of his own, he turned to the music of the western world that he had become so familiar with in his early years of performance. His use of Baul & Indian rhythms combined with the Reggae produced his own brand of World Music-Babu's New Age, Bengali Folk Fusion is the result. \\n\\nBabukishan has also worked with top Indian musicians/singers and music directors such as R.D.Burman, Ravi Shankar, Sultan Khan and Zakir Hussain. \\n\\nAs a composer, Babukishan has written the music for several albums, TV serials and films, earning a good reputation as one of the most promising composer in the Bollywood (Indian cinema) music & film industry of India. In his recordings, Babukishan features folk music, romantic songs, pop songs, ghazals, Qawwali music, new age, fusion, Sufi music and bhajans (devotional/spiritual songs). He is the first singer and music composer from the rich Baul family tradition to venture into fusion music by combining Baul/Sufi music with western music and reggae music. Babukishan produced and directed two documentary films about folk music and he wrote a book titled The Bauls of Bengal. One of Babukishan's latest projects is the band \\\"\\\"Birds\\\"\\\", which he founded. It combines new age, world music/traditional folk and fusion music. His album Soulmate\\\"\\\" (Universal/Music India) creates a unique new generation music worldwide.and his latest album, Birds & soul mind & body are based on Baul/Sufi music.\\\"\\\"GYPSYINDIA\\\"\\\" is authentic traditional baul & sufi music written/composed and all the instruments played by him.this album recored at woodstock,newyork during his tour on 2004.\\n\\n \\n\\nhttp://babukishan.com\\nhttp://cdbaby.com/cd/babukishan\\nhttp://community.webshots.com/user/babukishan\\\"\",\"\\\"\\n\\n Why has this been completely removed?

I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I\\u2019m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English.

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?\\n\\nMany regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the \\\"\\\"Nationalism\\\"\\\" movement, the \\\"\\\"Nationalist\\\"\\\" magazine, the \\\"\\\"Nationalist Educational Association,\\\"\\\" their dogma of \\\"\\\"military socialism,\\\"\\\" and Edward inspired the \\\"\\\"Nationalist Party.\\\"\\\"  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (\\\"\\\"Hakenkreuz\\\"\\\" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \\\"\\\"S\\\"\\\" letters for their \\\"\\\"socialism.\\\"\\\"  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized \\\"\\\"S\\\"\\\" letter for \\\"\\\"socialist.\\\"\\\" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol.

Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939.
