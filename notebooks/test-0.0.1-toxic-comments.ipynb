The spam/vandalism was indeed added by 221.197.20.66—the same spammer/vandal returned today via 221.198.74.212. Since this is an obvious (and shameless) attempt to use Wikipedia to increase the page ranking of the spammer's website (see Wikipedia:Spam), I've put in a request at m:Non-development tasks for developers#Spam regex requests to have the domain shop263.com added to the project-wide spam filter. With any luck, a developer will see the request before too long. Once the domain is on the filter, a page containing the domain cannot be saved (annoyingly, there are ways to get around this, but it usually takes care of the problem).\n",

      "I would appreciate your leaving the mention in. First Ansel Adams, in his three volume 1980 basic photography series, presented the Zone system this way and he explicitly said, in so many words, that his aim is not to force his own system of photography on anyone, but to encourage photographers to better understand their equipment in order to control the finished photograph. He disapproved of winging it, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived in Montreal) who told students not to bother with it, and it seems he was not alone. \n",

The Holy Spirit will come when HE thinks you're ready.  You can pray, too, but it may not be a good idea to ask for the Holy Spirit so fast if you're not ready because if you somehow grieve the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit leaves, the Holy Spirit will never return (unless by a miracle) and you won't be able to go to heaven.  But if you're a child, living under our parents, you can go to heaven (as long as we aren't doing anything really evil, such as murder), but your parents, who have to be true Christians with the Holy Spirit, would have to be praying to God for you to go to heaven.  So if you want the Holy Spirit, all you have to do is try your best to be a Christian and wait.  But sometimes when I pray to God, I ask HIM, \"\"Please give me the Holy Spirit when I'm ready.\"\"  I'm not sure exactly how you'll know when you have the Holy Spirit, but my mommy says that you'll find comfort with God and being more Christian.
