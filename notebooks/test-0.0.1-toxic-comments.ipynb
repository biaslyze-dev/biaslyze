          "Evolution Article\n\nHello Slrubinstein, I was a witness to the vast changes in the evolution article. Once it started it was like a wild fire. In fact, I saw it coming and tried (and failed-oddly phrased and hyperlinked on Dec 8)to improve the first paragraph. After Adam's changes, I realized the experts have had their say it seems appropriate to let the novices have ago. I wrote to Roland and Graft with this sentiment, but also my apprehensions-that it is too simplestic, may lead to misconceptions, not neccessarily improved where it is good, and this method of rapid and bulky changes will start a stampede (which it has). Roland is studying for exams, but dropped in enough to say he hated all the changes. I have been trying to be supportive of their effort, but hoping all the expert editors who gave me a hard time would resurface to defend the merits of the original article. I thought the first paragraph did need some attention, but I thought minor edits would ensue not vast rewrites. This could go on forever. Why can't an article be protected at certain stage so Talk could continue but changes would go before a committee to decide whether the change or addition is warranted (keep it current). I actually wrote a section for Evodev a few weeks ago, but never added it. I was concentrating on a couple of good examples, but now I realize a better way. There is some movement in embryology and developmental biology which is good. Fill does have some good editing for a Simple:evolution article. Isn't there a wikipedia for kids also? Although I wanted to change or add to the original, it was an excellent and informative article. It has been a week since the major overhaul so now maybe it is time to critique.",

          "===Belated Merry Christmas and Hello from N.Srinivasan: a few submissions on contradictions in Indian History pages: Thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages:=\n\nDear Tiptoety,\n\nI request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by User Dinesh Kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources, is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.\n\nThis communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of Wikipedia and nothing else. \n\nIt has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of Wikipedia pages, whatever we do users like Dinesh Kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from POV websites etc.  \n\nJust take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the Chalukya Empires especially with reference to the Chola Empire (pls. also remember that in Wikipedia for God knows what reason, the pages on the Chola Empire have been christened as Chola Dynasty despite that the fact that the Cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in India but also overseas including Sri Lanka, Maldives, very large parts of South East Asia for at least 150 years of their existence.  Here are the examples: but before that I would like to say this that deliberately, user Dinesh Kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the Chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the Chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the Chola empire (saying that the Chola territories were taken over by the Pandiyas), which has a great weakness:  \n\nthe Chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from 1126 onwards and between 1135/1140 to 1175 their kings were displaced and the Kalachuris under Bijjala I and Bijjala II ruled Kannada country in India.  The Chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just 10-15 years between 1185 to 1198 after which they went into oblivion.  I request  that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the Cholas, whose kings from AD 1170 though were not as strong as their kings between AD 848-1165, yet one of their last great kings Kulothunga III on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied Madurai, Karur and Sri Lanka (then known as Ilangai) between 1185-1200 AD.  He ruled for around 45 years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the Pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty, having Hoysalas as his allies.  Yet, even with weak kings following him after 1218, the Cholas lasted till 1279, when their last king lost to the Pandiyas and the Cholas went into oblivion.  \n\nContrast the above i.e. the demise of the Cholas in 1279 or 1280 to that of the Chalukyas, who were first of all without a capital for over 35 years and re-emerged for just 10-15 years and became history by AD 1195 or thereabouts.  Yet, jingoism seems to get the better of user Dinesh Kannambadi and he has written in the Western Chalukya Empire page as under:  the link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukyas and the relevant portion of text is the following:\n\n“This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.”\nThough (technically speaking at least) as per the version of Dinesh Kannambadi, the Chalukyas fell and demised in 1191/1195 and the Cholas demised after almost 9 decades in about 1279/80…. i.e. within a hundred years of each other… I would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression …”This period saw the fall of two great empires…”  I mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other, then the expression could be a little contemporaneous… but even as a weak empire the Cholas lasted till 1280 almost 84 years after the Chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the Cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the Chalukya dynasty, which went into oblivion in the year 1191 or 1195???? \n\nThe point is that whether it is mentioning the Hoysalas another Kannada empire or the Chalukyas, he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the Cholas.. even while mentioning Chalukya architecture, user Dinesh Kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the Cholas;;; see this write u",

We had a very difficult time months ago removing Mexico from Central America in the article North America. Why? Because an \"\"anonimous\"\" user (IP from Toronto Canada) was reverting all the changes. I finally discovered he was an already registered user and got him blocked because of sockpuppetry. One month later, I found out he was already been accused of sockpuppetry with that account.\n\nWell my point is that he is against of Mexico being included in North America. His main \"\"argument\"\" was that the UN geosheme includes Mexico in CA and that's it. He also denies that North America is also a subregion of America and ignores the cited content proving him wrong. Well, he is Corticopia. For months he was retired and trust me, NO BODY changed the articles North America and Central America (specially this one) to say Mexico was in CA.\n\nSuddenly a \"\"new\"\" user shows up. He deleted a line in the article CA. It said \"\"Mexico is rarely, yet sometimes included in Central America under certain definitions\"\". This line was discussed and agreed. He changed it to \"\"Mexico is included in Central America\"\" then to \"\"Mexico is sometimes included in Central America\"\".\n\nI don't know what his problem is. The important thing is I totally felt this is the same person we had a very serious vandalism problems months ago, so I checked his edit list. Wow! What a discovery, his first edit was the article Issac Asimov and articles about Canada and some other regions of the world. It was very obvious it was the same person. Please check this sources  and this . Please, read them carefully.\n\nPlease check the contributions of each accused sockpuppetry account, specially the one of User:Ex post factoid. It is very obvious he is the same person.\n\nHe was dragged into the article Mexico when he was unable to \"\"win\"\" again in the article Central America (he didn't even try to change the article North America because he knows a lot of people guard that article). So his reason to say Mexico is in \"\"Southern North America\"\" are purely false and personal. He wants to \"\"exclude\"\" Mexico or make it \"\"look\"\" appart from Canda and the USA.\n\nI'm telling you this because I think you don't realize his reasons are just personal, a personal aversion against Mexico being included in North America. If he's so interested in accuracy of the articles, why isn't he editing the article USA? He even asked Supaman to do it by himself. He's just there to exclude Mexico. Please read carefully the evidence provided in each sockpuppetry case. You said that you're an administrator in Spanish Wikipedia, so I think you're experienced in these cases. You will find it is the same person. Cortiopia has edited the same pattern of articles that the other accounts did. Too bad I warned him and I'm sure he stopped editing with that account to prevent being identified. I think we should stop him and prevent him from editing the article with his biased, excluding information, even if sourced, because his reasons are just personal and not for the sake of accuracy.

          "\"== plants ==\n\nI find the first sentences of this article very strange. I don't think vegetarians primarily eat plants or that it's synonymous with herbivore. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, honey, and yogurt, are not plants. Even plant parts is a bit of a stretch. Is flour a plant? My understanding is that vegetarians do not eat meat.   \nIt looks like an accurate description to me. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, beans, and flour all come from plants - I don't think it's necessary to eat the whole plant to be considered to be eating plants. Plants aren't even mentioned in the first sentences of the article.  \nI see that mention of plants has recently been removed. The word vegetarian obviously indicates a plant-based diet.  \nA nut may come from a tree, but it is not a plant. See dictionary. Yogurt is not a plant. Honey is not a plant. Fruit is not a plant. You seem to be confusing the meaning of words, which is problematic for someone working on an encyclopedia.   \nI think you'll find that trees are plants. Foods that come from plants are plant-based foods. It isn't rocket science.  \nThe article seems have been clarified which is helpful. Clearly there is a difference between a herbivore (a moose or cow for example) and a vegetarian that eats plant based foods like nuts, fruit and sometimes non-plant based foods dairy. Cheers.   \nI removed a newly-added sentence in the intro saying \"\"Some vegetarians eat eggs and fish\"\" because the very next sentence says exactly the same thing.   \n\nI removed \"\"focusing on plant-based foods\"\", since a diet of solely dairy products and eggs, while unhealthy, would technically be vegetarian. Simply put, not all vegetarian diets \"\"focus\"\" on plant-based foods. As per the citations, vegetarianism is really just defined by what it excludes, not what it includes. -  \nIt would only be true of certain forms of vegetarianism, so the plant-based nature of the diet needs to be included.  \nWhat about fungi? They aren't plants are they?   \nFungi are fungi, not plants. Sigh... vegetarians... '' (T↔C) \nCorrect, they are not plants. Just in case anyone is still confused: nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, and flour are all plant-based foods; they come from plants. Honey, yogurt, other dairy products, and eggs are animal-based foods; mushrooms and yeast are fungus-based foods; and algae (including edible seaweed like kelp) are none of the above. Also for the record, I'm vegetarian. -  \n(response to Michig) I don't understand your logic here. If some vegetarian diets do not focus on plant-based foods, then would it not be inaccurate to make the blanket statement \"\"vegetarian diets focus on plant-based foods\"\"? -  \nCan you seriously imagine a vegetarian diet without plant-based foods? The lede should summarize the article, and if you read the article it discusses plant-based foods all the way through it. The Vegetarian Society's definition: \"\"We define a vegetarian as someone living on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits, with or without the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or crustacea, or slaughter by-products.\"\" Doesn't that sound very plant-based to you? The plant-based foods are the fundamental part of the diet, with some'' types of vegetarians also adding dairy and eggs.   \nThe (sourced) entence \"\"The vegetarian diet is generally based on fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, nuts, and seeds\"\" was removed, which would have helped",

          "With respect, A2Kafir is misunderstanding the problem with Ruy Lopez's edits. The problem is not that FUNK and GRUNK are obscure acronyms (that could be dealt with by explanation), but that they were bogus (largely non-existent in fact) organisations, created to keep Sihanouk happy and create a facade of respectibility for the Khmer Rouge for the benefit of gullible foreigners (like me at the time). The reality was that the communist Khmer Rouge leadership ran the whole operation, as they showed at once when they came to power. Because Ruy Lopez is a communist and an apologist for the Khmer Rouge, he seeks to impose a completely false view of these organisations on the article. Presumably if he wrote articles on FUNK and GRUNK he would do the same thing there, thus creating yet more revert wars. The solution is not the creation of more articles but the consistent reversion of Ruy Lopez's falsehoods.  23:55, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)",

Sure the British were impressing \"\"American\"\" subjects into the Royal Navy and the NATIVE AMERICANS were at times hostile but the Americans weren't saints. To be honest the War of 1812 was one of the biggest disasters America has faced - their invasion of Canada bloodily repulsed, Native Americans supported by the British and Canadians, A British Army torching Washington DC (in retaliation for the torching of York during the winter season) and ending up marching at will around central america doing what they wanted until a peace treaty was signed. American prestige was only \"\"restored\"\" after a meaningless battle in New Orelans AFTER THE WAR ENDED. Regardless of what people say, this war did not prove Young America could hold their own against the old world, it showed they bit off more than they could chew in attempting to subjugate and forcibly liberate Canada against the populace's will. Don't forget half the canadian population were loyalists during the American revolution and Britain was fighting the might of Napoleon in Europe, so the War of 1812 was something of a sideline campaign.

This is the only edit which matches the accusations laid against me by JamesBWatson when he unfairly declined my block request, the comment was as follows: \"\"Users like you are the reason why I decided to leave here about 5 years ago. I cannot believe how utterly rude and disingenous you have been. You only took that user to wp:ani because they refused your help. Then you allowed their messages to be deleted which quite clearly show they are willing to undergo teaching, but because it wasn't from you, you didn't like that did you? Without a doubt the removal of barnstars and reaction to the welcome message was beyond the pale, and should have been dealt with by a short admin block, but your dishonesty surrounding this matter is utterly repulsive. I am very, very tempted to create an account just to have you dealt with for your actions\"\". I fail to see how this was any worse than what gets said and ignored by many other editors, but I apologised for it and made clear that I understood why I was blocked, which guidelines I broke and that I accepted my mistake. \n  This was the last comment on the ani debate, and the one for which I apologised to Thumperward because it was posted after he closed the debate. The full post read: \"\"What should you have done? Try leaving them alone like they asked, that's usually a good start, then try not allowing messages that could have vindicated them to be deleted from your talk page. He/she did not want your help. At that juncture, you COULD have advised him about how to contact uninvolved editors, but instead you chose to take it personally and spite him by taking him here. As for \"\"rudely\"\", would that be like launching an edit war on his/her own talk page?\"\"\n  This was a comment in the debate. It reads: \"\"I'm not commenting \"\"on behalf\"\" of anyone, I'm just trying to come to terms with why this situation devolved so rapidly. I wasn't aware that IP's were forbidden from contributing here? Or are you trying to suggest some sort of ulterior motive? My comment about Wikipedia review was meant to state that he/she probably had some sort of idea about how attitudes work here, which has been proven absolutely right, sadly. I like the way the original point of my last message was ignored. Or don't you see it as strange that a user who refused help from an editor has now been dragged here for being distruptive by the very same editor he/she clearly had an issue with? And don't you find it even slightly off that the very message asking for help was deleted by an involved outside user? Or are you more interested in playing semantics? As for the reaction to the welcome message, it was wrong and probably should have bee dealt with, but not like this\"\"\n  This is another comment on the debate, which reads: \"\"Ah, so that is what it is?

There are no 'alleged illegal activities' for Karl Rove because there is no charging document as in, \"\"Karl Rove is here charged with violating federal statute XX.22.XYZ.\"\"  Therefore, as I asserted way back in the summer, you cannot say, \"\"To date, no charges have been filed against Rove for his alleged illegal activities,\"\" since there are no alleged illegal activities.  No one in the federal prosecutors office is claiming Karl Rove has done anything illegal.  They were just angry that he defied coming in to answer questions which is his legal right to do.  He wasn't being charged with anything, therefore he did not have to speak with anybody. Then the prosecutor told the judge she was looking into possible criminal activity.  That changes the rules and now she is allowed to compel anybody in the Bush administration to come to answer questions.  Which she did and Rove showed up on time and answered every question.  Therefore, removing the weasel phrase that includes, \"\"so far no criminal charges have been filed against his alleged illegal activities,\"\" is correct.  You cannot say he has 'alleged illegal activities' unless he's been formally charged with a crime.

I have gone out of my way to provide detailed information on sources and where those sources can be located. In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious, but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians. Jdorney uses two main sources...CAIN and Lost Lives. CAIN is a \"\"estimation\"\" at best, and the US State Dept. Jane's Intelligence, British  Human Rights Watch, the Council On Foreign Relations, and various books and articles...all take issue with CAIN's facts and figures. As for Lost Lives, I have the latest edition of that book, and Jdorney completey fabricates the figures. If one reads carefully from 1969-2005, they see the number given as 86, shown as the amount of UDA and UVF members killed by IRA and INLA units. 85% of that number are given credit soley to the IRA. I wonder if jdorney even has the book, since he misquotes it so often. Similar numbers I have provided as to the number and units of British and Irish killed by the IRA is similarly backed up by Lost Lives...if one actually takes the time to read it throughly. I am not going to respond to any more whiney, and childish messages by jdorney. I have informed Wikipedia staff about his biased and unprofessional behavior, and have recieved back that Wikipedia will look into it. It is sad that Wikipedia has to be hampered by a few biased, purposely innacurate Editors, who ignore facts and make up their own...just to support their own one sided views.\n\nPS. Jdorney can leave more messages for me if he wants, but I will not respond to them, and all will be forwarded to Wikipedia staff for review.\n\nI will also continue to monitor the IRA article and this article, to ensure that the correct facts are not continually changed, by a editor, who I doubt will be with Wikipedia much longer:)\"",

This was not supported by any objective reference in the article and, in fact, it is something not endorsed by the UN (see below), which at least provides some ground for not accepting the self-government of Gibraltar as a self-evident fact. Therefore, I substituted it for some referenced facts.\n\n2) The article referenced the fact that Gibraltar is on the UN's non self-governing territories list but British and Gibraltarian polititians think that it should be removed. Only it was lost somewhere in the middle of this (long) article. I repositioned this information to the introduction of the article where it summarises the territory's political nature. It does not matter if 50 years ago it was the UK who nominated Gibraltar for the list: this status is reviewed every year and has not yet been reverted by UN's Special Committee.\n\nWhat surprises me is: I would have expected that if you disagree with my edits, you would discuss them or, if you think they do not offer a holistic view, you complete them with additional referenced facts. Instead of that, you just deleted the edits and accused me of edit warring.\n\nI will appreciate your discussing the changes and contributing with additional insight and referenced facts. Please do not merely undo my edits.\n\nKind regards.  \n\nIf you want to discuss this the appropriate place is the talk page of the article, not here as this is not a matter between you and justin.  The reality is that since the 2006 constitution Gibraltar is manifestly self governing, sadly progress on delisting it by the UN C24 is hampered by Spain's foolish attitude and intransigence.  It is amusing that that committee is comprised of representatives of states with less democracy than Gibraltar and if you follow the proceedings they have been singularly useless in achieving anything in relation to their remit on ANY territory such that the GoG declined to attend further meetings.  In relation to the politics of Gibralar, which is what the article is about, the UN is irrelevent - indeed the committee has not even visited the territory in question despite being invited to do so by the GoG and the UK. They are not so much a paper tiger as a limp piece of used bog roll.   \n\nPlease do not insult my intelligence that your intentions were anything other than to push a POV with that edit.  The facts remain that Gibraltar is self-governing.  It is only Spain that for its own political agenda denies this and the UN C24 is discussed in the article.

          "\"Please read the following article carefully in order to understand the real world-wide recognised history \n- As somebody else said, the \"\"nation of Transylvania\"\" DOES NOT EXIST, it is pure ROMANIA and Romanians! Therefore, we will tell some real history here. Within the chronicles of Herodotus , one may find that he described the Dacians(Getae) as the nation living within the present Romanian and Moldavian territory, including the part that is called Transylvania today, which means “beyond the forests”, after the Latin definition given by Romans and which consisted of the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Plains. A more accountable map can be found here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Dacia_82_BC.png .. Therefore, the nation living there consisted of dacians, which were known as Geton (plural Getae) in Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) and Getae in Roman documents. The dacians were conquered, after great efforts, by the Romans and Dacia was transformed into a Roman Province. Following, it was  a period of Romanization, period when the main Romanian people rose. As an answer to the Magyar origin, the history says that their starting point within the actual Hungary is related to the invasion of the Mongols ruled by Genghis Han and the Huns ruled by Attila within the European territory. After their settlement within the Pannonian Plains, the Hungarian people emerged, by mixing with the local populations. As a clear conclusion, one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of Dacians and the territory within they lived, called today Transilvania/Transylvania. The truth that has to be admitted is that Dacians/Getae were here as a nation BEFORE the Hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality. Moreover, NEITHER the Mongols and Huns NOR the actual Hungarians WERE here BEFORE the Romanization of Dacians, therefore they were not present before the emerging stage of the Romanian people. International history admits that the Hungarians appeared within today’s Hungary territory around the 9th century A.C. (according to Britannica) as an immigrating people coming from the actual Tibet region/Mongolia. After settlement they conquered Transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land. Bear in mind that Romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin, dating from Daco-Romans times and they will never stop viewing Trasilvania as their own home! If the Hungarians want to live without conflicts, they should stop claiming what does not belong to them, the Transylvania land. PEACE! \n\n\"",

          "Slovenian football clubs founding years\nHello, i noticed many new articles for defunct slovenian football clubs in the last time and most of them seems correct. But I think there is a problem about some clubs and that there shouldn't be two articles about the same club. There I have in mind specially Factor and Triglav. I don't know where and how the assocciation got those dates, but i think they are somehow not correct. The problem is that those clubs have a competition continuation and are different cases as Olimpija or Ljubljana. Interblock was supposely formed in 2007, so please explain how is it possible for a new formed club to start competing in a first league. The same thing for Triglav, how is it possible for a new formed club Triglav Kranj to compete (and win) in second league 1997, when the club was just formed that year.",

          "\"\n\n Suggestions / Concerns \n\nIntro paragraph:\nAnte Pavelić (14 July 1889 – 28 December 1959) was Croatian fascist leader,[1] revolutionist[2] and politician.[3] He ruled as Poglavnik[note 1] of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia.[4] In the 1930s, he was a founding member and leader of the Croatian fascist[5] ultra-nationalist separatist movement, the Ustaše. In 1941, having been installed by the Axis occupation as leader of a Croat puppet state, he instituted a racial policy that led to genocide over hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma in the NDH concentration camps, along with Croat political opponents and resistance members. At the end of the war, Pavelić escaped abroad. He died from wounds caused by an assassination attempt in Madrid on 28 December 1959.\n\nIncorporating the term fascist is POV. Ante Pavelic was not the leader of Croatia's Fascist Party (one has never existed). The term puppet state is also POV, out of all the countries mentioned in the Eichmann trial, Croatia was the only one that a notable Nazi considered to be a sovereign republic. If we can not change the \"\"puppet state\"\" tag, such information should be included because it would support the neutrality of this article. Axis-occupied Yugoslavia is also an irrelevant term as Yugoslavia did not defacto exist then (the one that was formed after the war was not the same as the one prior to, neither of them had defacto or dejure control) and today these regions have different names. If anything I would suggest that it be noted within Axis-Occupied Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina if anything. Saying that the Ustasa movement was installed is also POV. Hitler first wished to keep together Yugoslavia and tried to install Vladko Macek, which didn't happen. Slavko Kvatrenik declared Croatian independence prior to German's entering Zagreb and they simply accepted it. If the Ustasa movement was installed it couldn't have been by several parties at once, and if so, those parties would have recoginzed Croatia's independence that very day. Italy actually recognized Croatia a week or two before Germany did. The latter part about a racial party is nonsense. The Ustasa leadership instituted a Racial Policy towards only Jews. It should be noted that this Racial Policy was the only European anti-semitic policy that has unique notions granting special aryan status to Jews who supported the Croatian statehood cause prior to April of 1941. To say that Pavelic escaped is also misleading because ally special service agencies knew where he was the whole time.   \"",
          "\"\n\n Bloc voting \n\nCountries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91] \n\nThis is full-blown crazy. What does \"\"non-nationals\"\" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time.

I believe that Spanish speaking populations outside Ceuta and Melila are neglectable. I'm raising this issue at the Commons. Tnak you!  \nThe text even states that Northern Morocco was a Spanish colony! if you read the article on Morocco, the situation was much more complex, it states \"\"Successful Portuguese efforts to invade and control the Atlantic coast in the fifteenth century did not profoundly affect the Mediterranean heart of Morocco. After the Napoleonic Wars, Egypt and the North African maghreb became increasingly ungovernable from Istanbul, the resort of pirates under local beys, and as Europe industrialized, an increasingly prized potential for colonization. The Maghreb had far greater proven wealth than the unknown rest of Africa and a location of strategic importance affecting the exit from the Mediterranean. For the first time, Morocco became a state of some interest in itself to the European Powers. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830. Recognition by the United Kingdom in 1904 of France's sphere of influence in Morocco provoked a German reaction; the crisis of June 1905 was resolved at the Algeciras Conference, Spain in 1906, which formalized France's \"\"special position\"\" and entrusted policing of Morocco to France and Spain jointly. A second Moroccan crisis provoked by Berlin, increased tensions between European powers. The Treaty of Fez (signed on March 30, 1912) made Morocco a protectorate of France. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern Saharan zones on November 27 that year.\"\"! \"",

They like the article and had few suggestions on issues/problems of content. One is looking into several minor details and will report back to me. If we move sections of the article to sub articles it may help the article become a GA or FA but will make the article less educational because the sections we will move to sub articles are the most important for understanding Deming's philosophy. So the question is should we do that or leave it and polish areas of the article through copy editing? One Swedish Deming scholar intends to translate the article for Swedish Wikipedia and encouraged others to do the sane for their language versions.  \n\n\"",

The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place.

Apprently her mother had asked her to choose a Muslim partner and not live in sin therefore, she decided to live with her boyfriend saying her mother only converted to Islam after decades of being a non-Muslim wife of man who was born a Muslim. So there you have ita sister and brother admitting to being non-Muslims. ([User: Moarrikh[)",

Also you mentioned that you don't care about what image is being used, than why did you personally re-editted the picture yourselve? CAN YOU REALLY SAY THERE IS NO RACISM IN WIKIPEDIA. Don't you know that there are people who can hide their racism intentionally?, as long as they prove the points they want everyone to see they don't need to tell you they are racist. These people uses something called \"\" bias racism \"\" to hide their racist intentions to prove their point on one hand, but on the other hand they back it with evidence to make it acceptable, to the point where you can't accuse them of being racist because they would use stuffs genetics or human evolution to back up their claims as reasonable. Like for example an wiki user before in the Australian aborigine wiki page had this similar intention, this wiki user for some reason decided to use an Australian aborigine women with strange features, very ape looking ( 99% of Australian aborigines don't like that) but of all of picture she insists on using this australian aborigine women with ape looking traits.  Some people call it racist, while others say it's not. While wiki user claimed she is not racist but  the fact is that picture she used in a way depicted Australian aborigines as ape looking.

This is also not denied by any average Iranian, more or less familiar with history. So stop making reverts without consulting the Talk page.

Once it started it was like a wild fire. In fact, I saw it coming and tried (and failed-oddly phrased and hyperlinked on Dec 8)to improve the first paragraph. After Adam's changes, I realized the experts have had their say it seems appropriate to let the novices have ago. I wrote to Roland and Graft with this sentiment, but also my apprehensions-that it is too simplestic, may lead to misconceptions, not neccessarily improved where it is good, and this method of rapid and bulky changes will start a stampede (which it has). Roland is studying for exams, but dropped in enough to say he hated all the changes. I have been trying to be supportive of their effort, but hoping all the expert editors who gave me a hard time would resurface to defend the merits of the original article. I thought the first paragraph did need some attention, but I thought minor edits would ensue not vast rewrites. This could go on forever. Why can't an article be protected at certain stage so Talk could continue but changes would go before a committee to decide whether the change or addition is warranted (keep it current). I actually wrote a section for Evodev a few weeks ago, but never added it. I was concentrating on a couple of good examples, but now I realize a better way. There is some movement in embryology and developmental biology which is good. Fill does have some good editing for a Simple:evolution article. Isn't there a wikipedia for kids also?

Here are the examples: but before that I would like to say this that deliberately, user Dinesh Kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the Chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the Chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the Chola empire (saying that the Chola territories were taken over by the Pandiyas), which has a great weakness:  \\n\\nthe Chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from 1126 onwards and between 1135/1140 to 1175 their kings were displaced and the Kalachuris under Bijjala I and Bijjala II ruled Kannada country in India.  The Chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just 10-15 years between 1185 to 1198 after which they went into oblivion.  I request  that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the Cholas, whose kings from AD 1170 though were not as strong as their kings between AD 848-1165, yet one of their last great kings Kulothunga III on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied Madurai, Karur and Sri Lanka (then known as Ilangai) between 1185-1200 AD.  He ruled for around 45 years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the Pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty, having Hoysalas as his allies.  Yet, even with weak kings following him after 1218, the Cholas lasted till 1279, when their last king lost to the Pandiyas and the Cholas went into oblivion.  \\n\\nContrast the above i.e. the demise of the Cholas in 1279 or 1280 to that of the Chalukyas, who were first of all without a capital for over 35 years and re-emerged for just 10-15 years and became history by AD 1195 or thereabouts.  Yet, jingoism seems to get the better of user Dinesh Kannambadi and he has written in the Western Chalukya Empire page as under:  the link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukyas and the relevant portion of text is the following:\\n\\n\\u201cThis period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.\\u201d\\nThough (technically speaking at least) as per the version of Dinesh Kannambadi, the Chalukyas fell and demised in 1191/1195 and the Cholas demised after almost 9 decades in about 1279/80\\u2026. i.e. within a hundred years of each other\\u2026 I would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression \\u2026\\u201dThis period saw the fall of two great empires\\u2026\\u201d  I mean what is meant by \\u201cthis period\\u201d surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other, then the expression could be a little contemporaneous\\u2026 but even as a weak empire the Cholas lasted till 1280 almost 84 years after the Chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the Cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the Chalukya dynasty, which went into oblivion in the year 1191 or 1195???? \\n\\nThe point is that whether it is mentioning the Hoysalas another Kannada empire or the Chalukyas, he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the Cholas.. even while mentioning Chalukya architecture, user Dinesh Kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the Cholas;;; see this write u\",\"Given the contentious history of race relations in the United States...particularly African-American history from the slave trade through the Civil Rights era...IMO being the first African-American president is a critical aspect of Obama's biography, and deserves first-sentence prominence.\",\"ING Mexico's operations today is largely composed by its acquisition of Seguros Comercial America which was Mexico's largest insurance company, they are now loosing their number one position to currently number five (huge market loss), as the public deoes not trust them with their insurance needs,this Company was also dominant in the property and casualty markets, until a series of irregularities surfaced and became publicly known, now they are still currently loosing their vast portfolio because of ineptly and negligently handling all of their various insurance claims amongst them the huge the Fertinal claim, which was caused by an insured hurricane loss in 2001, this was a total loss as the Insureds Mine in Baja California was totally destroyed and inundated under water by Hurricane Juliette, the initial estimated loss was in the region of US Dollars 84 million, now it is around the region of 184 million, this for Direct Damage only, additionally they have to add Loss of Profits and now Loss of Market which is valued in the billions of US Dollars!\\n\\nAs of the 14th of July 2005 they have been ordered by a mexivcan judge in a court ruling to pay in excess of USD 300 million plus compound interest accrued as of November 2001 to Fertinal (a local prestigiuos mining conglomerate) this because of the repeated refusal to pay a large proceeding claim, which as of May 29th, 2006 has not been paid, of course ING is resorting to all kinds of legal maneuvers in order to avoid paying said incurred claim,additionally the Dutch Management inexcussably and ineptly (and again in a wrong tactical move, wrong as they insult the local Mexican Judiciary by calling them corrupt adding insult to injury) blame it on the supposedly corrupt Mexican Judges instead of blaming it really on their own inept and corrupt local staff once headed by Alfonso Romo (who is currently under criminal investigation by his own shareholders, amongst them and led by his father in law, for alleged money mismanagement in the Savia affair) and his useless and reckless staff! It was about time they honor their due!

I don't think vegetarians primarily eat plants or that it's synonymous with herbivore. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, honey, and yogurt, are not plants. Even plant parts is a bit of a stretch. Is flour a plant? My understanding is that vegetarians do not eat meat.   \\nIt looks like an accurate description to me. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, beans, and flour all come from plants - I don't think it's necessary to eat the whole plant to be considered to be eating plants. Plants aren't even mentioned in the first sentences of the article.  \\nI see that mention of plants has recently been removed. The word vegetarian obviously indicates a plant-based diet.  \\nA nut may come from a tree, but it is not a plant. See dictionary. Yogurt is not a plant. Honey is not a plant. Fruit is not a plant. You seem to be confusing the meaning of words, which is problematic for someone working on an encyclopedia.   \\nI think you'll find that trees are plants. Foods that come from plants are plant-based foods. It isn't rocket science.  \\nThe article seems have been clarified which is helpful. Clearly there is a difference between a herbivore (a moose or cow for example) and a vegetarian that eats plant based foods like nuts, fruit and sometimes non-plant based foods dairy. Cheers.   \\nI removed a newly-added sentence in the intro saying \\\"\\\"Some vegetarians eat eggs and fish\\\"\\\" because the very next sentence says exactly the same thing.   \\n\\nI removed \\\"\\\"focusing on plant-based foods\\\"\\\", since a diet of solely dairy products and eggs, while unhealthy, would technically be vegetarian. Simply put, not all vegetarian diets \\\"\\\"focus\\\"\\\" on plant-based foods. As per the citations, vegetarianism is really just defined by what it excludes, not what it includes. -  \\nIt would only be true of certain forms of vegetarianism, so the plant-based nature of the diet needs to be included.  \\nWhat about fungi? They aren't plants are they?   \\nFungi are fungi, not plants. Sigh... vegetarians... '' (T\\u2194C) \\nCorrect, they are not plants. Just in case anyone is still confused: nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, and flour are all plant-based foods; they come from plants. Honey, yogurt, other dairy products, and eggs are animal-based foods; mushrooms and yeast are fungus-based foods; and algae (including edible seaweed like kelp) are none of the above. Also for the record, I'm vegetarian. -  \\n(response to Michig) I don't understand your logic here. If some vegetarian diets do not focus on plant-based foods, then would it not be inaccurate to make the blanket statement \\\"\\\"vegetarian diets focus on plant-based foods\\\"\\\"? -  \\nCan you seriously imagine a vegetarian diet without plant-based foods? The lede should summarize the article, and if you read the article it discusses plant-based foods all the way through it. The Vegetarian Society's definition: \\\"\\\"We define a vegetarian as someone living on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits, with or without the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or crustacea, or slaughter by-products.\\\"\\\" Doesn't that sound very plant-based to you? The plant-based foods are the fundamental part of the diet, with some'' types of vegetarians also adding dairy and eggs.   \\nThe (sourced) entence \\\"\\\"The vegetarian diet is generally based on fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, nuts, and seeds\\\"\\\" was removed, which would have helped\",\"\\\"\\n\\nThe name is mentioned at the top of the page.

Cheers! \\u2014 \\\"\",\"With respect, A2Kafir is misunderstanding the problem with Ruy Lopez's edits. The problem is not that FUNK and GRUNK are obscure acronyms (that could be dealt with by explanation), but that they were bogus (largely non-existent in fact) organisations, created to keep Sihanouk happy and create a facade of respectibility for the Khmer Rouge for the benefit of gullible foreigners (like me at the time). The reality was that the communist Khmer Rouge leadership ran the whole operation, as they showed at once when they came to power. Because Ruy Lopez is a communist and an apologist for the Khmer Rouge, he seeks to impose a completely false view of these organisations on the article. Presumably if he wrote articles on FUNK and GRUNK he would do the same thing there, thus creating yet more revert wars. The solution is not the creation of more articles but the consistent reversion of Ruy Lopez's falsehoods.  23:55, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)\",\"\\\"Special:Contributions/75.70.99.101|75.70.99.101]]  \\n\\nUmm, he shouldn't be categorized as anything specifically, as is how they've generally done it with all prominent people who didn't leave enough information on wikipedia.

Sure the British were impressing \\\"\\\"American\\\"\\\" subjects into the Royal Navy and the NATIVE AMERICANS were at times hostile but the Americans weren't saints. To be honest the War of 1812 was one of the biggest disasters America has faced - their invasion of Canada bloodily repulsed, Native Americans supported by the British and Canadians, A British Army torching Washington DC (in retaliation for the torching of York during the winter season) and ending up marching at will around central america doing what they wanted until a peace treaty was signed. American prestige was only \\\"\\\"restored\\\"\\\" after a meaningless battle in New Orelans AFTER THE WAR ENDED.

Don't forget half the canadian population were loyalists during the American revolution and Britain was fighting the might of Napoleon in Europe, so the War of 1812 was something of a sideline campaign.

No one in the federal prosecutors office is claiming Karl Rove has done anything illegal.  They were just angry that he defied coming in to answer questions which is his legal right to do.  He wasn't being charged with anything, therefore he did not have to speak with anybody. Then the prosecutor told the judge she was looking into possible criminal activity.  That changes the rules and now she is allowed to compel anybody in the Bush administration to come to answer questions.  Which she did and Rove showed up on time and answered every question.  Therefore, removing the weasel phrase that includes, \\\"\\\"so far no criminal charges have been filed against his alleged illegal activities,\\\"\\\" is correct.  You cannot say he has 'alleged illegal activities' unless he's been formally charged with a crime.

In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious, but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians. Jdorney uses two main sources...CAIN and Lost Lives. CAIN is a \\\"\\\"estimation\\\"\\\" at best, and the US State Dept.

I wonder if jdorney even has the book, since he misquotes it so often.

This was not supported by any objective reference in the article and, in fact, it is something not endorsed by the UN (see below), which at least provides some ground for not accepting the self-government of Gibraltar as a self-evident fact. Therefore, I substituted it for some referenced facts.\\n\\n2) The article referenced the fact that Gibraltar is on the UN's non self-governing territories list but British and Gibraltarian polititians think that it should be removed. Only it was lost somewhere in the middle of this (long) article. I repositioned this information to the introduction of the article where it summarises the territory's political nature. It does not matter if 50 years ago it was the UK who nominated Gibraltar for the list: this status is reviewed every year and has not yet been reverted by UN's Special Committee.\\n\\nWhat surprises me is: I would have expected that if you disagree with my edits, you would discuss them or, if you think they do not offer a holistic view, you complete them with additional referenced facts.

Please do not merely undo my edits.\\n\\nKind regards.  \\n\\nIf you want to discuss this the appropriate place is the talk page of the article, not here as this is not a matter between you and justin.  The reality is that since the 2006 constitution Gibraltar is manifestly self governing, sadly progress on delisting it by the UN C24 is hampered by Spain's foolish attitude and intransigence.  It is amusing that that committee is comprised of representatives of states with less democracy than Gibraltar and if you follow the proceedings they have been singularly useless in achieving anything in relation to their remit on ANY territory such that the GoG declined to attend further meetings.  In relation to the politics of Gibralar, which is what the article is about, the UN is irrelevent - indeed the committee has not even visited the territory in question despite being invited to do so by the GoG and the UK. They are not so much a paper tiger as a limp piece of used bog roll.   \\n\\nPlease do not insult my intelligence that your intentions were anything other than to push a POV with that edit.  The facts remain that Gibraltar is self-governing.  It is only Spain that for its own political agenda denies this and the UN C24 is discussed in the article.

Therefore, we will tell some real history here. Within the chronicles of Herodotus , one may find that he described the Dacians(Getae) as the nation living within the present Romanian and Moldavian territory, including the part that is called Transylvania today, which means \\u201cbeyond the forests\\u201d, after the Latin definition given by Romans and which consisted of the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Plains. A more accountable map can be found here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Dacia_82_BC.png .. Therefore, the nation living there consisted of dacians, which were known as Geton (plural Getae) in Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) and Getae in Roman documents. The dacians were conquered, after great efforts, by the Romans and Dacia was transformed into a Roman Province. Following, it was  a period of Romanization, period when the main Romanian people rose. As an answer to the Magyar origin, the history says that their starting point within the actual Hungary is related to the invasion of the Mongols ruled by Genghis Han and the Huns ruled by Attila within the European territory. After their settlement within the Pannonian Plains, the Hungarian people emerged, by mixing with the local populations. As a clear conclusion, one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of Dacians and the territory within they lived, called today Transilvania/Transylvania. The truth that has to be admitted is that Dacians/Getae were here as a nation BEFORE the Hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality. Moreover, NEITHER the Mongols and Huns NOR the actual Hungarians WERE here BEFORE the Romanization of Dacians, therefore they were not present before the emerging stage of the Romanian people. International history admits that the Hungarians appeared within today\\u2019s Hungary territory around the 9th century A.C. (according to Britannica) as an immigrating people coming from the actual Tibet region/Mongolia. After settlement they conquered Transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land. Bear in mind that Romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin, dating from Daco-Romans times and they will never stop viewing Trasilvania as their own home! If the Hungarians want to live without conflicts, they should stop claiming what does not belong to them, the Transylvania land. PEACE! \\n\\n\\\"\",\"Thanks.

In 1941, having been installed by the Axis occupation as leader of a Croat puppet state, he instituted a racial policy that led to genocide over hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma in the NDH concentration camps, along with Croat political opponents and resistance members. At the end of the war, Paveli\\u0107 escaped abroad. He died from wounds caused by an assassination attempt in Madrid on 28 December 1959.\\n\\nIncorporating the term fascist is POV. Ante Pavelic was not the leader of Croatia's Fascist Party (one has never existed). The term puppet state is also POV, out of all the countries mentioned in the Eichmann trial, Croatia was the only one that a notable Nazi considered to be a sovereign republic. If we can not change the \\\"\\\"puppet state\\\"\\\" tag, such information should be included because it would support the neutrality of this article. Axis-occupied Yugoslavia is also an irrelevant term as Yugoslavia did not defacto exist then (the one that was formed after the war was not the same as the one prior to, neither of them had defacto or dejure control) and today these regions have different names. If anything I would suggest that it be noted within Axis-Occupied Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina if anything. Saying that the Ustasa movement was installed is also POV. Hitler first wished to keep together Yugoslavia and tried to install Vladko Macek, which didn't happen. Slavko Kvatrenik declared Croatian independence prior to German's entering Zagreb and they simply accepted it. If the Ustasa movement was installed it couldn't have been by several parties at once, and if so, those parties would have recoginzed Croatia's independence that very day. Italy actually recognized Croatia a week or two before Germany did. The latter part about a racial party is nonsense. The Ustasa leadership instituted a Racial Policy towards only Jews. It should be noted that this Racial Policy was the only European anti-semitic policy that has unique notions granting special aryan status to Jews who supported the Croatian statehood cause prior to April of 1941. To say that Pavelic escaped is also misleading because ally special service agencies knew where he was the whole time.   \\\"\",\"\\\"\\n\\n Bloc voting \\n\\nCountries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91] \\n\\nThis is full-blown crazy. What does \\\"\\\"non-nationals\\\"\\\" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time. It's the language and sensibility.\\\"\",\"\\\"\\n\\nMorocco and Western Sahara\\nIn the map Morocco and Western Sahara appear as Hispanophone (albeit stating that they are  \\\"\\\"Countries and regions where the Spanish language is spoken without official recognition, or where Spanish-based cr\\u00e9ole languages (Chamorro, Chavacano, Papiamento, Portu\\u00f1ol, etc) are spoken with or without official recognition, and areas with a strong Hispanic influence.\\\"\\\"). I believe that Spanish speaking populations outside Ceuta and Melila are neglectable. I'm raising this issue at the Commons. Tnak you!  \\nThe text even states that Northern Morocco was a Spanish colony! if you read the article on Morocco, the situation was much more complex, it states \\\"\\\"Successful Portuguese efforts to invade and control the Atlantic coast in the fifteenth century did not profoundly affect the Mediterranean heart of Morocco. After the Napoleonic Wars, Egypt and the North African maghreb became increasingly ungovernable from Istanbul, the resort of pirates under local beys, and as Europe industrialized, an increasingly prized potential for colonization. The Maghreb had far greater proven wealth than the unknown rest of Africa and a location of strategic importance affecting the exit from the Mediterranean. For the first time, Morocco became a state of some interest in itself to the European Powers. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830. Recognition by the United Kingdom in 1904 of France's sphere of influence in Morocco provoked a German reaction; the crisis of June 1905 was resolved at the Algeciras Conference, Spain in 1906, which formalized France's \\\"\\\"special position\\\"\\\" and entrusted policing of Morocco to France and Spain jointly. A second Moroccan crisis provoked by Berlin, increased tensions between European powers. The Treaty of Fez (signed on March 30, 1912) made Morocco a protectorate of France. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern Saharan zones on November 27 that year.\\\"\\\"! \\\"\",\"\\\"Bosnia fiction text and outdated souce ==\\n\\nThe source from February 17, before any of the high officials from the presidency and MFA made their statements, says:\\nAs to the political aspect of Kosovo's looming independence, Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to some of the reactions of its officials so far, will try to keep a neutral position due to a complex domestic political scene and numerous unsolved political and economic issues in the country.\\nBut the article says this (citing that source):\\nApart from statements from the three presidents, \\\"\\\"Bosnia and Herzegovina [...] will try to keep a neutral position due to a complex domestic political scene and numerous unsolved political and economic issues in the country.\\\"\\\"\\nNotice the difference between these two (maybe I should even say \\\"\\\"falsifying skew\\\"\\\" ;)).\\n\\nQuestions are:\\nsays who? is there a name of the person making this statement?\\nwhen? on february 17 before all other statements or afterwards?\\nwhere did we come up with speech marks if there is no quoted statement in the source?\\nis there any specific reason to remove the statement by the minister of foreign affairs?\\n\\n  \\n\\n== \\\"\",\"\\\"\\n\\nI suppose that's one way of looking at it.

If we move sections of the article to sub articles it may help the article become a GA or FA but will make the article less educational because the sections we will move to sub articles are the most important for understanding Deming's philosophy.

Nasser's sister Benazir a ballerina, was featured in a sunday magazine. She explained why she had chosen to live with a black man rather than marry him. Apprently her mother had asked her to choose a Muslim partner and not live in sin therefore, she decided to live with her boyfriend saying her mother only converted to Islam after decades of being a non-Muslim wife of man who was born a Muslim.

These people uses something called \\\"\\\" bias racism \\\"\\\" to hide their racist intentions to prove their point on one hand, but on the other hand they back it with evidence to make it acceptable, to the point where you can't accuse them of being racist because they would use stuffs genetics or human evolution to back up their claims as reasonable.
